# Cold DM Templates — LinkedIn

**Target:** VP/Director of Marketing at agencies (20–100 people) who've posted about AI tools.

## Template 1: The Observation Hook

> Hey {first_name} — saw your post about {specific_AI_tool_they_mentioned}. Smart move adopting it early.
>
> Quick question: after rolling out new AI tools, did your team's actual output go up proportionally? Most agencies I talk to see maybe 20% of the gains they expected.
>
> The gap is almost never the tool — it's the workflow around it. I run a 90-minute session called a Workflow Surgery where we pick one process, map it live, and you walk away with 3 specific changes to close that gap.
>
> Running them at $50 during beta (normally $500). Worth a conversation?

## Template 2: The Contrarian Angle

> Hi {first_name} — your take on {AI_topic_they_posted_about} was sharp. Most people in the space are talking about which tools to buy. Almost nobody's talking about whether their processes can actually absorb them.
>
> I've been mapping AI-augmented workflows at agencies your size and keep finding the same thing: 10+ hours/week of hidden waste that new tools actually made worse. Redundant reviews, broken handoffs, approval loops that exist because nobody updated the process.
>
> I do a 90-minute Workflow Surgery — we pick one workflow, walk through it, and I give you 3 ranked changes. $50 beta price.
>
> Open to trying it?

## Template 3: The Social Proof Lead

> {first_name} — noticed you're scaling your team's AI stack. Respect the ambition.
>
> I've been helping agencies figure out why their AI tools aren't delivering the time savings everyone promised. Turns out the bottleneck is almost always workflow design, not the tech.
>
> I run something called a Workflow Surgery: 90 minutes, one process, and you leave with a visual map plus 3 implementable changes ranked by ROI. It's like a code review but for your operations.
>
> Doing beta pricing at $50 right now (goes to $500). Would you be down to try it on one workflow?

## Usage Notes

- **Personalize the hook**: Reference their specific post or the specific AI tool they mentioned. Generic = ignored.
- **Send Tuesday–Thursday**, 8–10 AM their local time.
- **Follow up once** after 3–5 days if no response. Don't follow up more than that.
- **Connection request first**: Send a connection request with no note. DM after they accept.
- **Don't pitch in the connection request.** That's the fastest way to get ignored.
